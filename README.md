This is a playground repo that uses some of the upcoming new features of [Nativewind v4](http://www.nativewind.dev). It picks up the [Chadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) theme configuration and translates it to Nativewind. With that it takes the basic building blocks of the Button components to enable the variants feature into it.
